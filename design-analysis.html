    <h1>Design - Analysis Assessment</h1>

    <h2>Design Principles</h2>

    <h3>Proximity —</h3>
    <img class="img" src="Proximity.JPG" alt="espn example of proximity">
    <p class ="explaination">ESPN.com makes good use of proximity. The principle of proximity says that like items 
        should be close and visibly separated from unalike items. ESPN does a nice job of grouping 
        similar items together by sport, topic, as well as other criteria. As you can see in this 
        picture, the main method they use to group is the boxes that the groups are contained in. 
        They are subtle. It is a slight color difference from the background, but it helps the mind 
        group like things together in a wonderful way. Alike items are close to each other in the boxes 
        and the boxes provide the break for items that are different. </p>

    <h3>Alignment —</h3>
    <img class="img" src="Alignment.JPG" alt="espn example of alignment">
    <p class ="explaination">ESPN.com also does a superb job in applying the principle of alignment. Alignment creates 
        structure and balance in a website. As you can see in the following screenshot, there is 
        a strong left alignment with the logos for the different categories.  This provides a 
        structure for the viewer to know that each time one sees a logo left aligned in that matter, 
        then a new topic is being viewed.  The logo is not the only consistent alignment in the 
        screenshot. The headers for each section and the body text are aligned at the same place. 
        These strong alignments are visually appealing and will help the viewer have a better experience.</p>
